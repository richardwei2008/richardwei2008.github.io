<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Process design consists of two major tasks: the first task is to conceive the nature of the resources that make up the process by positioning the process in terms of its volume and variety characteristics; the second task is concerned with the analysis of the objectives and activities of the process (Slack, Brandon-Jones, Johnston, Betts, 2015). The facility layout is concerned with finding the most efficient arrangement of every resource needed for production of goods or delivery of services (Drira, Pierreval, Hajri-Gabouj, 2007). Researchers also identified several core criteria that make a good process. And these attributes are effective, efficient, relevant, valid, usable, used, reused, managed and measured (Davis, 2009). Recent and emerging trends in positioning and analysing are mainly focusing on specific manufacturing industry such as chemical (Towler, Sinnott, 2012). Academics also attempted to provide an integrating financial perspective into business process design (Vom Brocke, Recker, Mendling, 2010). To speak of facility layout, during the past three decades, various articles discussed from problem solving perspective such as heuristic algorithms (Kusiak, Heragu, 1987), optimization softwares (Meller, Gau, 1996) and more recently genetic algorithms as well as dynamic considerations. However, seldom systematic analysis tried to link the relationship between process design and facility layout and how the two problem could affect each other. This article will analyse two concrete cases from logistics industry to analysis their interdependencies and correlation. Finally, the essay will end up with a brief discussion on the limitations as well as justifications of critical factors and recommendations.</p>

<h2>Process design might consider facility layout (Transportation Network)</h2>

<p>It is known that there are generally four types of facility layout: 1) fixed position layout, 2) functional layout, 3) cell layout, 4) product layout (Slack et al., 2015). The basic model of the logistic transportation network consists of nodes (the facility such as customer sites, stores, platforms and hubs) and arcs (the lines or routes that vehicle follow to transport the goods). The locations of customer sites are determined by the market demand, which is out of control from logistic service provider perspective. The stores are setup by logistic service provider to collect parcels or goods within limit area, which require certain level of capital investment and the amount of stores is depending on the demand. Platforms are small hubs that normally cover small cities or area with limited population. Hubs are very large facilities, which can rarely be relocated and it takes a large proportion of fixed assets of a logistic company. Local stores can be identified as service shops, which are characterised between the extremes of professional and mass service. While hubs are typical facilities that provide mass services. There are no more than 20 direct line for even busiest hubs in the East coast of China. Large amount of parcels is combined in the platforms or hubs to haulage them via main line which is called trunk. Considering the problem of cost and flexibility, it is more preferable to design and optimize the process according to this type of facility layout. Because once a location is settle down, it is unlikely to change it again within short period of time. In this situation, the key to process selection or optimization is to ensure lower costs, better efficiency, throughput and quality. For example, it is advised to design the coverage of pick-and-delivery area as well as the timing of these tasks for each store in terms of different local market situation. On the other hand, from the hubs perspective, high efficient intelligence transport dispatcher, which can recognise the destination by RFID or QR code, might be introduced. It could automate the manual and error-prone tasks. Other optimization opportunity might related to the long haulage arrangement and slot-truck management within a hub. In short, for fixed position facility layout, it is recommended to make improvements from process design perspective and the relocation is always the last choice to consider.</p>

<h2>Facility layout might accommodate to process (Warehousing)</h2>

<p>Warehousing generally consists of two processes: inbound operations (including receiving and returns) and outbound operations (including picking and shipping). However, in terms of the characteristic of different goods (e.g. medicine, chemicals, normal grocery, fresh vegetables or fruits, frozen stuff and etc.) stored in the warehouse, the facility layout of the warehouse can be very different from one and the other. According to the warehouse within the distribution network, the facility layout of a retailing warehouse is also different from those central warehouse. Moreover, considering the business that warehouse serves for B2C business (e.g. online ecommerce) or B2B business (e.g. supermarket inventory and replenishment), there is a wide range of choices for the the facility layout. As the facilities settled in a warehouse are comparatively easier to relocate or replace and the standarised operation processes for specific storage goods are well established, facility layout might accommodate to process design. To achieve overall performance, it is suggested that people not only decide how large pick faces should be, velocity, and the number of times to replenish from process perspective, but also take into account issues like the arrangement of cubes and the shipping dock space from facility layout perspective. The problems of facility layout and process design are essentially affected with each other.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum up, based on evidences analysed in the above cases, process design and facility layout are tightly correlated, and they have mutual effects on each other. To obtain effect and efficient process, in addition to key principles such as 1) requirement and business strategy, 2) process governance, 3) process architecture and structure, 4) IT alignment, 5) monitoring, 6) continuous improvement (Davis, 2009), one should also consider its associated facility layout. The facility layout should also be able to evolve with the advance of process design. This article only provides a qualitative analysis on specific business domain. Future research could be advised to exam cases from various industries. As both process design and facility layout are derived from higher-level business strategy, product strategy and operations strategy, more sophisticated quantitative methodology might be preferred to evaluate their relation from objectives or results perspective, criteria might include but not limit to capital requirements, market factors, cost factors, future flexibility, risk factors (Slack et al., 2015). Other factors such as the competencies of staff, organisational culture and structure, stakeholders (e.g. customers, suppliers, competitors and customers) are of great importance that can not be neglect.</p>
